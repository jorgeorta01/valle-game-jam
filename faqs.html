    <h2>What is a Game Jam? </h2>
    <p>A game jam is an event in which participants will make a game from scratch. Depending on the game format, participants will either work 		individually or in teams. 
      Teams will generally consist of programmers, writers, artists and game designers. 
      The game format is our focus which includes a theme, restriction and a time limit. 
      The format will be announced one week before the event begins.
